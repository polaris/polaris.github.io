Hi, my name is Jan Deinhard. I studied digital media and work as a software engineer in Hamburg. This blog is deticated to improving myself as a software engineer. I am very much interested in the C++ programming language as well as its standards and libraries such as STL and many of the Boost C++ Libraries. Furthermore, I enjoy working with JavaScript on the Node.js platform and Python.
